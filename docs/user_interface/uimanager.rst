UI Manager
==========


Description
-----------
The UIManager is meant to handle all UIs without knowing what exactly is inside the UI. This manager provides a central point for all the UIs to talk to, so that there are no interfering UIs.

**Features include:**

* Queueing UI.
* Going back to the previous UI.
* Capturing and releasing the mouse cursor.
* Dismissing UI.
* Loading level.
* Quiting.

Method Descriptions
-------------------

* void **RegisterBaseUI** ( :godot_class:`node` node )

You can select a node in the tree to be the parent of all the UIs. The UIManager wil handle the adding and removing of the UI. This function should be used in ``_ready``.

* void **NextUI** ( :godot_class:`string` path )

A new instance of a UI is made and added to the tree. Resource should be a path like ``"res://UI/menu.tscn"`` for example.

* :godot_class:`bool` **CanGoBack** ( )

Returns true when there is a previous UI availble to which the UIManager can return.

* void **Back** ( )

The UIManager will go back to the previous UI if one is available. It will ignore this when the history queue is empty.

* void **DismissUI** ( )

The displayed UI will be removed from the tree. If there are any future queued UIs or UIs in the history queue it will go to that.

* void **ClearUI** ( )

The current UI will be removed and all queued UIs will be ignored.

* :godot_class:`bool` **RequestFocus** ( )

Returns true if there currently is no UI that has focus. Use ``ReleaseFocus`` when done.

* void **ReleaseFocus** ( )

Once focus is no longer needed it can be released, making character controls work again for example.


Example
-------
Before a UI can be added to the UIManager a base needs to be registered. This base is the parent node of the UI. The UIManager handles the ``add_child`` and ``remove_child``, so there is no need to do this manually.

.. sourcecode:: gdscript

  var ui_resource = "res://assets/my_ui.tscn"
  var added_ui = false

  func _ready():
	 UIManager.RegisterBaseUI(self)


Once the base has been registered, then the UI can be added at will.
In this example a menu will be toggled on and off when a key is pressed.
The menu script needs to keep track of adding or removing the UI by using a boolean.

.. sourcecode:: gdscript

    func _input(event):
      if event.is_action_pressed("ui_button"):
		    if added_ui:
			     UIManager.ClearUI()
			     added_ui = false
		    elif UIManager.RequestFocus():
			     UIManager.SwitchUI(ui_resource)
			     added_ui = true
