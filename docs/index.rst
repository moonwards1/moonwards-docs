What is Moonwards?
------------------
What if a group of nations was determined to colonize the Moon, and they based their decisions only on technical and economic merit?

Ok, not a real town, a virtual moon with a virtual town, full of digital models of all the structures and machinery involved.
Designs are absolutely technically feasible and sensible. They are based on an extensive, expansive timeline into the future,
grounded in solid science and practical engineering.
